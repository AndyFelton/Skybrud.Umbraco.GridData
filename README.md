Skybrud.Umbraco.GridData
========================

**Skybrud.Umbraco.GridData** is a small package with a strongly typed model for the new grid that is soon to be released in Umbraco 7.2. The package let's you deserialize the stored JSON value similar to this:

```C#
GridData gridData = GridData.Deserialize(json);
```

You can then use the model in your MVC views, master pages or even in your custom logic - eg. to index the grid data in Examine for better searches.

## Download

The package is still at an early stage, so there are no options for downloading the package yet.
